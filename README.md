**Greetings!!!**

- 💜 I graduated from University of Washington, majored in Economics and minored in Informatics, go go Huskies!
- ❤ I'm studying at Carnegie Mellon University, MSPPM-DA program, I'm probably the stupidest guy at CMU.
- 🤔 I'm OK using R, SQL, python, like I am probably able to feed myself using these skills.
- 🎸 I love bands! Big fan of Mandarin Indi Musics and Nirvana(Kurt Cobain fanboy)!
- 🙇‍♂️ I like trying some designs. Dude, if I am good at drawing though, I'd definitely not major in Economics.
