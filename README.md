**Greetings!!!**

- üíú I graduated from University of Washington, majored in Economics and minored in Informatics, go go Huskies!
- ‚ù§ I'm studying at Carnegie Mellon University, MSPPM-DA program, I'm probably the stupidest guy at CMU.
- ü§î I'm OK using R, SQL, python, like I am probably able to feed myself using these skills.
- üé∏ I love bands! Big fan of Mandarin Indi Musics and Nirvana(Kurt Cobain fanboy)!
- üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I like trying some designs. Dude, if I am good at drawing though, I'd definitely not major in Economics.
